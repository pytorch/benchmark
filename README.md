# Pytorch Benchmarks
This is a collection of open source benchmarks used to evaluate pytorch performance.

`models` contains copies of popular or exemplary workloads which have been modified to
(a) expose a standardized API for benchmark drivers, (b) optionally, be JITable,
 (c) contain a miniature version of train/test data and a dependency install script.

## Running Model Benchmarks
There are currently two top-level scripts for running the models.

`test.py` offers the simplest wrapper around the infrastructure for iterating through each model and installing and executing it.

test_bench.py is a pytest-benchmark script that leverages the same infrastructure but collects benchmark statistics and supports filtering ala pytest.  

In each model repo, the assumption is that the user would already have all of the torch family of packages installed (torch, torchtext, torchvision, ...) but it installs the rest of the dependencies for the model.

### Using `test.py`
`python test.py` will execute the setup and run steps for each model.

Note: setup steps require connectivity, make sure to enable a proxy if needed.

### Using pytest-benchmark driver
Run `python test.py --setup_only` first to cause setup steps for each model to happen.

`pytest test_bench.py` invokes the benchmark driver.  See `--help` for a complete list of options.  

Some useful options include
- `--benchmark-autosave` (or other save related flags) to get .json output
- `-k <filter expression>` (standard pytest filtering)
- `--collect-only` only show what tests would run, useful to see what models there are or debug your filter expression

## Nightly CI runs
Currently, models run on nightly pytorch builds and push data to scuba.

## Adding new models

See [Adding Models](torchbenchmark/models/ADDING_MODELS.md).

## Legacy
See `legacy` for rnn benchmarks and related scripts that were previously at the top level of this repo.
