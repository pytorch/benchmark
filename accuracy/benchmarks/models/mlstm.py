    #   - This implementation uses the trick of having all gates concatenated
    #     together into a single tensor, so you can do one matrix multiply to
    #     compute all the gates.
    #   - Thus, w_ih holds W_hx, W_ix, W_ox, W_fx
    #       and w_hh holds W_hh, W_ih, W_oh, W_fh
    #   - Notice that the indices are swapped, because F.linear has swapped
    #     arguments.  "Cancelling" indices are always next to each other.
